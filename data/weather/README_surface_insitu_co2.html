We have introduced the term "measurement group", which identifies
the group within NOAA and INSTAAR that made the actual measurement.
We can now have multiple groups measuring some of the same trace 
gas species in our discrete samples.  

Measurement groups within NOAA and INSTAAR are 

  ccgg:  NOAA Carbon Cycle Greenhouse Gases (CCGG)
  hats:  NOAA Halocarbons and other Atmospheric Trace Species (HATS)
  arl:   INSTAAR Atmospheric Research Laboratory (ARL)
  sil:   INSTAAR Stable Isotope Laboratory (SIL)
  curl:  INSTAAR Laboratory for Radiocarbon Preparation and Research (CURL)

We have also changed the file naming convention (see section "DATA - FILE 
NAME DESCRIPTION").

Project-specific notes:

2017-01-24
===================================================================

The method used to apply flags to the hourly average data was 
changed for the years 1973-2014, to agree with the method used for 
the 2015 and 2016 data.  This means that daily and monthly
averages for those earlier years may have changed by small amounts 
for data packages from previous years.  Hourly values were not affected
by this change, only the flags. See 
https:/www.esrl.noaa.gov/gmd/ccgg/about/co2_measurements.html
for more details.

===================================================================
2011-10-13

Quasi-continuous CO2 dry air mole fractions from 1980 to 2006 have all 
been recalculated to bring them into the WMO X2007 Mole Fraction 
Scale (X07). The data since 2007 were already on the X07 scale. 
WMO X2007 is based on repeated manometric measurements of the NOAA 
primary standards (Zhao et al. 2006) and comparison of those results 
to similar measurements made over a period of more than 10 years at 
Scripps Institution of Oceanography.  The difference between the X07 
and the previous scales propagated by SIO and NOAA (X83, X87, etc.) 
is ~0.2 ppm (X07-previous) in the 1980s, decreasing to ~0.1 ppm in 
the late 1990s, and to 0.0 ppm by 2006. The recalculation of individual 
measurements was accomplished by first determining the X07 values for 
the reference gases used to measure the air samples and then using those 
values with the raw data (NDIR voltages) to recompute mole fractions
for each sample. 

===================================================================

===================================================================
1992-07-28

Compressed tar files are now available for transfer.
There are four files, one for each observatory.  Each tar file
contains all the files in the directory for that station, and
is named sta.in-situ.tar.Z where sta is the three letter station
code, 'brw', 'mlo', 'smo', or 'spo'.

===================================================================
1992-07-27

Preliminary data from Mauna Loa for 1991 is now available.
Changes to this data based on recalibration of reference gases
will occur in the future.

===================================================================
1992-07-27

Corrections to the Samoa data from January 1, 1988 to 
August 31, 1991 were made due to better determinations of the
reference gases used during this period.  Files affected were
smo88, smo89, smo90, smoday88, smoday89, smoday90, smomm.  The
data for 1991 were added to the archive. The new files are
smo91 and smoday91.  Data starting on September 1, 1991 are still
subject to revision.

===================================================================
1992-07-22

Preliminary data from Barrow for 1991 is now available.
Changes to this data based on recalibration of reference gases
will occur in the future.

===================================================================
1992-07-22

The types of flags used are currently under review.  Many
flags that were seldom used or were redundant in thier meaning 
will be replaced with more common flags.  The goal is to eventually
have only 8 base flags total; '  ', C, I, V, D, A, DN, and NC.
Any additional flags based on specific selection schemes for each
site will be noted in this file.

===================================================================
1992-07-22

The data selection for Barrow is not consistent for the
data set.  Data starting in 1981 has been given a more rigourous
selection than prior to this date, i.e., there are no D or A 
selection flags before 1981.

The data for Samoa from 1976 through 1987 have had an
additional selection based on wind direction and wind speed. 
(See Waterman et al., 1989).  A 'WD' code stands for data that
has been flagged because the wind direction was not from the clean
air sector.  A 'WS' speed is for data where the wind speed is
below a minimum value.  There are no 'A' flags in the data for
this time period.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.3 DATA - FILE TYPE

We now provide some NOAA Global Monitoring Division measurements
in two unique file formats (netCDF and ASCII text). The Network
Common Data Form (NetCDF) is a self-describing, machine-independent
data format that supports creation, access, and sharing of array-oriented
scientific data.  To learn more about netCDF and how to read netCDF
files, please visit http://www.unidata.ucar.edu. 

The ASCII text file is derived directly from the netCDF file.  The
text file is also self-describing and can be viewed using any text
editor.  "Self-describing" means the file includes enough information
about the included data (called metadata) that no additional file is 
required to understand the structure of the data and how to read and 
use the data.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.4 DATA - CONTENT

For each observatory record we provide an hourly, daily, and monthly
average file.  Daily averages are derived directly from the hourly data.
Monthly averages are derived from the daily averages.  Higher resolution
data (sub-hourly) are available upon request.


All (ASCII text and netCDF) files are located in 
"ftp://aftp.cmdl.noaa.gov/data/trace_gases/co2/in-situ/surface/[site]/".

Files are named as follows (see Section 7.2 for details):

     co2_[site]_surface-insitu_1_ccgg_HourlyData.[file type]
     co2_[site]_surface-insitu_1_ccgg_DailyData.[file type]
     co2_[site]_surface-insitu_1_ccgg_MonthlyData.[filetype]

-------------------------------------------------------------------
7.5 QC FLAGS

NOAA ESRL uses a 3-column quality control flag where each column
is defined as follows:

column 1    REJECTION flag.  An alphanumeric other
            than a period (.) in the FIRST column indicates
            a sample with obvious problems during collection
            or analysis.  This measurement should not be interpreted.

column 2    SELECTION flag.  An alphanumeric other than a
            period (.) in the SECOND column indicates a sample
            that is likely valid but does not meet selection
            criteria determined by the goals of a particular
            investigation.

column 3    INFORMATION flag.  An alphanumeric other than a period (.) 
            in the THIRD column provides additional information 
            about the collection or analysis of the sample.

            WARNING: A "P" in the 3rd column of the QC flag indicates
            the measurement result is preliminary and has not yet been 
            carefully examined by the PI.  The "P" flag is removed once 
            the quality of the measurement has been assessed.

SUMMARY OF SELECTION FLAGS

Missing data will have a value of -999.99 for the mole fraction.
Times are specified in Greenwich Mean Time. Hours are specified
as the beginning of the hour, for example, hour 5 corresponds to
5 AM to 6 AM GMT.

The selection process is done to distinguish "background" mole
fractions, that is, the values that we believe are not contaminated
by local sources or sinks of CO2.  The selection process depends
on the station (see references).  The selection code is a three
character code, where the first character indicates missing data or
instrumental problems, the second character indicates selection due 
to non-background criteria. The third character is not used for
data selection. The available codes are:

   ... - No code applied. Data are considered 'background'
   *.. - Unable to compute a mole fraction or average
   I.. - No data available due to instrument calibration or malfunction.
   .V. - Large variability of CO2 mole fraction within one hour
   .D. - Hour-to-hour difference in mole fraction &gt; 0.25 ppm
   .U. - Rejected, diurnal variation (upslope) in CO2 (Mauna Loa only)
   .S. - Single hour bracketed by flagged data.
   .N. - No unflagged data within +/- 8 hours. Assume non-background.

Missing data will have a value of -999.99 for the hour, and "background" 
values will be designated by a '.' character for the first two characters.
See also the 'Update_notes' file for information regarding other codes.

-------------------------------------------------------------------
